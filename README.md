# NOMYO Router

is a transparent proxy for [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) with model deployment aware routing.

It runs between your frontend application and Ollama backend and is transparent for both, the front- and backend.

# Installation

Copy/Clone the repository, edit the config.yaml by adding your Ollama backend servers and the max_concurrent_connections setting per endpoint. This equals to your OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL config settings.

Run the NOMYO Router in a dedicated virtual environment, install the requirements and run with uvicorn:

```
python3 -m venv .venv/router
source .venv/router/bin/activate
pip3 install requirements.txt -r 
```
finally you can

```
uvicorn router:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 12434
```

# Routing

NOMYO Router accepts any Ollama request on the configured port for any Ollama endpoint from your frontend application. It then checks the available backends for the specific request.
When the request is embed(dings), chat or generate the request will be forwarded to a single Ollama server, answered and send back to the router which forwards it back to the frontend.

If now a another request for the same model config is made, NOMYO Router is aware which model runs on which Ollama server and routes the request to an Ollama server where this model is already deployed.

If at the same time there are more than max concurrent connections than configured, NOMYO Router will route this request to another Ollama server for completion.

This way the Ollama backend servers are utilized more efficient than by simply using a wheighted, round-robin or least-connection approach.
